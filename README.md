### 👋 Hi, I'm Nathan Cheng
</br>

📊 📈 I design, engineer, and operate modern data analytics and machine learning  platforms on the cloud. 

Currently, I'm a [consultant](!https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathancheng-data) at Rackspace Technology helping customers become more data-driven, turning the ideas that provide business value from conception to production.

Outside of work, I also...

- 📝 [Write](!https://natworkeffects.medium.com) about data analytics / ML systems to share knowledge with the community of data nerds.
- 🎦 I'm currently watching: [Deep Learning](!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkRLdi-c79HKEWoi4oryj-Cx-e47y_NcM).
- 📚 I'm currently reading: [Machine Learning Design Patterns](!https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777).
